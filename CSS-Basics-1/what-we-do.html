<!--Colour Physchology of Purple
- Power; everyone who goes to PTEC knows how good it is!

- Creativity; a lot of what happens in PTEC revolves around creativity.

- Ambition; Google Dictionary definition: "a strong desire to do or to achieve something, typically requiring determination and hard work."
  It takes a lot of determination and hard work to be a student, especially at PTEC.

- Also, the PTEC logo is purple so I just thought it would suit its website nicely.
 However, I made it a brighter purple on purpose because the darker shade makes it seem more mysterious,
 and I don't think that's what a school should be. To make up for it, I added a little hint of 
 blue so it's almost like it slightly calms down the purple, doesn't make it seem as loud.


 The website was given a light theme because this page has more text than it does images.

colours were chosen using the analogus colour wheel. Some colours have lighter/darker variants 
(found with monochromatic) to improve the readability of the font.
