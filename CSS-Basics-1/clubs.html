                This club is all about hardening operating systems on computers
                by scrutinizing for, identifying and eliminating vulnerbilities.
                Practices happen after school. After many practices, students
                compete in the CyberPatriot Competition.

                Great for competitive gamers, PTEC has ESports teams for
                <i>Rocket League</i> and <i>League of Legends</i>. Students
                compete in-game against other students from other schools with
                ESports teams.

          <p>
            Video games such as <i>Mario Kart</i> and
            <i>Smash Bros Ultimate</i> are played on the big screen in the MPR.
            Happens once a week after school. Great for casual and competitive
            gamers alike. It is different from ESports league, as this club
            focuses on Nintendo Switch games.

          Photography club is good for students who like taking pictures and
          would like to sharpen their photography skills, and share them with
          fellow classmates. Takes place during lunch, once a week.
